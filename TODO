High Priority:
    * Design some maps.

Medium Priority:
    * Create a libfreetrail so different UIs are not so hard.
    * (WIP) Generi-size the XML parsing interface to not be so copy and paste

Low Priority:
    * Decide and implement a standard user interface for CLI
    * Write GTK2 interface
