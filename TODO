High Priority:
    * Use std::map for tracks storing locations and tracks

Medium Priority:
    * Untangle UI from implementation (very important later)
    * (WIP) Generi-size the XML parsing interface to not be so copy and paste
    * Replace many asserts with exceptions, and exception handling mechanisms.

Low Priority:
    * Decide and implement a standard user interface for CLI
    * Write GTK2 interface
