High Priority:
    * Use std::map for tracks storing locations and tracks

Medium Priority:
    * Untangle UI from implementation (very important later)
    * Generi-size the XML parsing interface to not be so copy and paste

Low Priority:
    * Decide and implement a standard user interface for CLI
    * Write GTK2 interface
