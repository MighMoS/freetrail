High Priority:
    * 

Medium Priority:
    * (WIP) Untangle UI from implementation (very important later)
      * So we can create a libfreetrail
    * (WIP) Generi-size the XML parsing interface to not be so copy and paste

Low Priority:
    * Don't mix pointers and references in each component. Decide on one and use it.
    * Decide and implement a standard user interface for CLI
    * Write GTK2 interface
