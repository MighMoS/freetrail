High Priority:
    * Fix infinite loop in journeying
    * Implement a map iterator so that we can...
        * Trash journey.cc and most of the world structures

Medium Priority:
    * Untangle UI from implementation (very important later)

Low Priority:
    * Decide and implement a standard user interface for CLI
    * Write GTK2 interface
